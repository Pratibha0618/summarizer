All eyes are now on whether Israel chooses to take further military action, while Washington seeks diplomatic measures instead to ease regional tensions.\n\nIran says the attack was in response to an airstrike widely blamed on Israel that destroyed what Iran says were consular offices in Syria and killed two generals with its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard earlier this month.\n\nIsrael said almost all the over 300 drones and missiles launched overnight by Iran were shot down by its anti-missile defense system, backed by the U.S. and Britain. The sole reported casualty was a wounded girl in southern Israel, and a missile struck an Israeli airbase, causing light damage.\n\nStill, the chief of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard called the operation successful.\n\nIran has managed to strike a balance between retaliating publicly for the strike in Damascus and avoiding provoking further Israeli military action at least initially, which could lead to a much wider conflict, said Mona Yacoubian, vice president of the Middle East and North Africa center at the U.S. Institute of Peace.\n\n“Both (Iran and Israel) are able at this point to claim victory and step down off the precipice, particularly since there were no Israeli civilians killed,” Yacoubian said.\n\nThe world was still waiting, however, for the result of an Israeli War Cabinet meeting on Sunday. Israeli hard-liners have pushed for a response, but others have suggested restraint, saying Israel should focus on strengthening budding ties with Arab partners.\n\"\"\"\n\nmodel.predict(sample_text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-21T10:21:26.806208Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-21T10:21:26.806653Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-21T10:21:27.310881Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-21T10:21:26.806622Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-21T10:21:27.309964Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"execution_count":18,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"[\"Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel marks change in approach\"]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"text_to_summarize = \"\"\"\nsummarize: The heavy rains that flooded Dubai in mid April halted air traffic, damaged buildings and streets—and left climate experts and common citizens asking whether one of the world’s hottest and driest cities should be better prepared for extreme storms.\n\nWeather forecasters knew days in advance that a major storm was heading for the United Arab Emirates and authorities issued warnings asking citizens to stay home.
